Description
-----------
Over the past 16 years, starting 2002, a number of road accidents have been reported and duly recorded.
This EDA, is meant to look into the data and uncover possible findings in a bid to learn from it and possibly curb future repetition .

We compare cumulative road accidents among other things on year , month and state.
